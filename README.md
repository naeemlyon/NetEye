Description
The program can be used as a nice remote administration tool, some fun with your friends on the net and you can watch / monitor the activity of remote machine. The network must support
TCP/IP.

Installation
NetEye consists of a server and a client-part. The server-part is the program which will be automatically invoked without informing the remote machine’s user. The client-part is the
program you use to connect to another computer. To install the NetEye server, you just run server part once a time, no need to run any installation
utility at all. In the NetEye-client you address the target with IP-numbers. Note You don’t see any application running at the remote machine when it’s running – it’s
hiding itself automatically.
